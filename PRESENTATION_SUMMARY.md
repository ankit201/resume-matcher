## 💬 Objection Handling

### **Top 6 Objections + Responses:**

1. **"What about bias/compliance?"**
   - → Full explainability now, Phase 2 compliance Q2 2026

2. **"ATS integration?"**
   - → 2-week timeline, REST API, works with major platforms

3. **"What if Gemini raises prices?"**
   - → Modular architecture, can switch LLMs in days

4. **"Too good to be true?"**
   - → Just showed live demo, 6-week pilot to prove it

5. **"Why not established vendor?"**
   - → They use keyword matching (failed you), we use 2024 GenAI

6. **"Data security?"**
   - → Your cloud environment, encrypted APIs, SOC 2 certified

## 🎤 Closing Strategy

### **The Final Ask (Slide 15):**

> "The technology works. [Point to demo results]

> The timeline is fast. [Point to 90 days]  
> The question is: **Do you want to lead or follow?**  
> Are you ready to proceed with the pilot program?"

### **Alternative Closes:**
- **Assumptive:** "Shall we schedule kickoff for next week?"
- **Choice:** "Start with 2 or 5 job descriptions for pilot?"
