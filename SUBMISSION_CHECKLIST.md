## 📞 Support Resources

### Documentation
- README.md - Main documentation
- QUICKSTART.md - Fast setup guide
- ARCHITECTURE.md - System design
- PRESENTATION_OUTLINE.md - Demo script

### Troubleshooting
- Check API keys in `.env`
- Run `./test_setup.py` for diagnostics
- Verify UV installed: `uv --version`
- Check Python version: `python3 --version`
- Reinstall deps: `uv pip install --force-reinstall -e .`

### Common Issues
1. **"Import Error"** → Run `./setup.sh` again
2. **"API Key Error"** → Check `.env` file, verify keys
3. **"Streamlit won't start"** → Check port 8501, try different port
4. **"PDF parsing fails"** → Verify Google AI key, check PDF file
5. **"Slow performance"** → First run downloads models (normal)
