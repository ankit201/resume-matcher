CRITICAL NUMBERS TO MEMORIZE
========================================

PAIN POINTS:
‚Ä¢ 40% false rejection rate (current vendor)
‚Ä¢ $2M annual cost (current vendor)
‚Ä¢ 3 weeks time-to-shortlist (current)

OUR PERFORMANCE:
‚Ä¢ 50 seconds per resume (LLM analysis)
‚Ä¢ 67ms per resume (semantic filter)
‚Ä¢ 83 minutes for 100 resumes (batch)
‚Ä¢ 2 seconds to filter 10,000 resumes
‚Ä¢ 3.6x speedup from parallelization

FINANCIAL:
‚Ä¢ $2,000,000 current annual cost
‚Ä¢ $12,000 our annual cost (hosting only)
‚Ä¢ $1,988,000 annual savings
‚Ä¢ 28 days payback period
‚Ä¢ $5.8M three-year savings
‚Ä¢ 1,226% ROI

MARKET CONTEXT:
‚Ä¢ 29% productivity gain from AI in HR (Gartner)
‚Ä¢ 87% companies face talent shortage
‚Ä¢ AI adoption in recruiting up 3x since 2023

========================================
LIKELY OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES
========================================

OBJECTION 1: "What about bias and compliance?"
RESPONSE: "Great question. Today, we provide full explainability‚Äî
every decision is documented with evidence. This prevents hidden bias.
For Phase 2 (Q2 2026), we'll add PII detection and demographic 
monitoring. We recommend launching now with transparency, adding 
compliance toolkit within 6 months."
[Reference Slide 13]

OBJECTION 2: "How do we know this will integrate with our ATS?"
RESPONSE: "We've planned a 2-week integration timeline in weeks 7-8. 
Our REST API outputs JSON that works with Workday, Greenhouse, and 
other major ATS platforms. We've done this before."
[Reference Slide 14, Appendix A]

OBJECTION 3: "What if Google raises Gemini prices?"
RESPONSE: "Our architecture is modular. We can switch to other LLMs 
(OpenAI, Anthropic, or open-source) within days. Even at commercial 
pricing, we're still under $50K/year vs your $2M vendor cost."
[Reference Slide 11 - Architecture]

OBJECTION 4: "This seems too good to be true."
RESPONSE: "I understand the skepticism. That's why we just showed you 
a live demo. The technology works today. The ROI is real because we're 
using free-tier AI and efficient architecture. And we're proposing a 
6-week pilot to prove it before full deployment."
[Reference Slides 6-8, 14]

OBJECTION 5: "Why not use an established vendor like Workday or HireVue?"
RESPONSE: "They use the same keyword matching that failed you. We're 
using 2024 GenAI technology‚Äîsemantic understanding with LLMs. That's 
the difference between 40% false rejection and 95%+ accuracy. Plus 
they charge $2M; we cost $12K."
[Reference Slide 5]

OBJECTION 6: "What about data security and privacy?"
RESPONSE: "All processing happens in your cloud environment (AWS/GCP). 
Resume data never leaves your infrastructure. We use encrypted API 
calls to Google's Gemini service, which is SOC 2 certified. Full 
control over your data."
[Reference Appendix A]

========================================
CLOSING TECHNIQUES
========================================

ASSUMPTIVE CLOSE:
"Based on what you've seen, shall we schedule the kickoff meeting 
for next week?"

CHOICE CLOSE:
"Would you prefer to start with 2 job descriptions or 5 for the 
pilot program?"

URGENCY CLOSE:
"Every week you wait costs $40K in vendor fees and loses qualified 
candidates. When can we start?"

TRIAL CLOSE (During Presentation):
After demo: "Does this level of transparency address your concerns?"
After financials: "Does the ROI make sense for your budget?"

FINAL CLOSE (Slide 15):
"The technology works. [Point to demo results]
The ROI is clear. [Point to $6M savings]
The timeline is fast. [Point to 90 days]
The question is: Do you want to lead or follow?
Are you ready to proceed with the pilot program?"

========================================

‚òê Send contract draft within 24 hours
‚òê Request ATS access details
‚òê Identify pilot job descriptions (2-5)
